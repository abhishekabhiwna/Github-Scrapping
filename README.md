 # Scraping Top Repositories for Topics on GitHub

## Web Scrapping
Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website. This information is collected and then exported into a format that is more useful for the user. Be it a spreadsheet or an API.

## Github
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere

## AIM
1)We're going to scrape https://github.com/topics using python,requests and beautifulsoup then going to convert the file in CSV format.

2)We'll get a list of topics. For each topic, we'll get topic title, topic page URL and topic description
